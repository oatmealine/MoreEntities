# MoreEntities
a plugin for [ahorn](https://github.com/CelestialCartographers/Ahorn) that adds more entites, triggers, etc to it (will be obsolete by ahorn jl1.0)

keep in mind any non-tagged ver is most likely broken, ill test the actual code once in 1-4 commits (refer to the broken debug chair - if it exists it's untested, if not it's tested)

thanks to [0x0ade](https://github.com/0x0ade/) for working big waterfalls, too much of a dummie to do them myself
