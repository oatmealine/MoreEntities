# MoreEntities
a plugin for [ahorn](https://github.com/CelestialCartographers/Ahorn) that adds more entites, triggers, etc to it (will be obsolete by ahorn jl1.0)

keep in mind any non-tagged ver is most likely broken, ill test the actual code once in 1-4 commits (refer to the broken debug chair - if it exists it's untested, if not it's tested)

# Install

clone/download the mod and put it in celeste dir/Mods like any other Everest mod (it doesnt actually change celeste in any way, this is just how ahorn reads mods. there's the option to place it in .ahorn/plugins but it doesnt support custom sprites from there)

![install screenshot](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/242402217498247179/543095256502108177/unknown.png "where to put it")

if you're on windows its recommended to unzip it as ahorn using zip's as mods is broken as of pre-ahorn jl 1.0 port
